# _Restaurant Homepage_

#### By _**Emma Gerigscott**_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _JavaScript_
* _Node.js_

## Description

My first attempt using webpack to build a site with tabs. The homepage has scrolling text (which is bad accessibility design! But I wanted to play with animations) and pictures of food. There is also a simple menu tab, about, and contact. Buckey's logo links back to the homepage. The tabs are not separate HTML pages but repopulate the index.html using the DOM.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repo to your desktop
* Navigate to the top of the directory
* Open index.html in your browser

## Known Bugs

* _Image links are broken on gh-pages deployment_
* _Menu tab is pretty...sparse_
